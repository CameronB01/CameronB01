## Hi there, my name is Cameron! ðŸ‘‹
---

I'm a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in all things numbers, and I'm fascinated by the amazing insights data can provide. I got my Bachelor's in Statistics (and a minor in Economics) from Western Washington University, and this experience really honed my analytical abilities and nurtured a deep admiration for numerical data.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Willamette University. This program is significantly enhancing my knowledge and skills in the field. I will be graduating at the end of August. I'll have Python, R, and SQL in my toolkit, ready to tackle any complex data challenges that come my way.

My GitHub showcases my abilities in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. I love uncovering patterns and trends hidden within datasets and turning them into insights you can act on.

Outside the world of academia, I've had the opportunity to gather some hands-on experience through three summer internships as a data science intern at a tech startup. This experience allowed me to put my skills to the test and further sharpen my abilities to tackle real-world data challenges head-on.

With my strong academic background, hands-on work experience, and never-ending curiosity, I can't wait to contribute my skills to exciting projects and collaborate with other data enthusiasts like myself.

Please feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn! I can't wait to hear from you!
