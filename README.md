### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in quantitative methods and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights. With a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and a minor in Economics from Western Washington University, I have honed my analytical skills and developed a deep appreciation for the power of numbers.

Currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Willamette University, I am expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field. Set to graduate in August 2024, I have gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, enabling me to tackle complex data challenges with ease.

My portfolio showcases a variety of projects that demonstrate my abilities in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. I thrive on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets, and translating them into actionable insights.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through three summers as a data science intern at a tech startup. These internships have allowed me to apply my skills in a professional setting, further refining my abilities to solve real-world data challenges.

As a quantitative finance enthusiast, I am particularly interested in applying my data science skills to the financial domain, leveraging advanced analytical techniques to drive informed decision-making and uncover profitable opportunities.

With a strong academic background, practical work experience, and a relentless curiosity, I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the data science community.
